# vite-boilerplate

This boilerplate is created to develop a frontend project into a Docker container. The reason is a simple workaround to the situation in which we have no privileges to install `npm` and the related dependencies into the machine.

## Possible improvements
- Add volume mount
- Verify after that, if:
	- Cache is deactivated
	- After modifying everything looks fine
